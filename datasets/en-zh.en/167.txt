NEW YORK – Conventional wisdom rarely survives a good stress test, and few tests have been as stressful as that which the global economy has endured over the past 24 months. A healthy season of reappraisal has dawned, shining a new light on boom-time notions like the value of opaque markets, the untouchable status of the American consumer, or the wisdom of deregulation.
One piece of bubble wisdom that has escaped relatively unscathed, however, is the assumption that the “BRIC” countries – Brazil, Russia, India, and China – will increasingly call the economic tune in years to come. The BRIC notion, coined in a 2003 Goldman Sachs report, is not all bad: at 75% correct, it scores a good deal better than most economic prognostications of the day.
Yet the economic crisis that began in 2008 exposed one of the four as an impostor. Set the vital statistics of the BRIC economies side-by-side and it becomes painfully obvious that, in the words of the old Sesame Street game, “One of these things is not like the other.”
The weakness of the Russian economy and its highly leveraged banks and corporations, in particular, which was masked in recent years by the windfall brought by spiking oil and gas prices, burst into full view as the global economy tumbled. Saddled with a rust-belt infrastructure, Russia further disqualifies itself with dysfunctional and revanchist politics and a demographic trend in near-terminal decline.
Even with the modest recovery in commodity prices over the past six months, Russia’s energy sector has experienced declining production in recent years, due in part to fears among foreign investors of expropriation. Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, integral in propping up an increasingly re-centralized economy, is being depleted fast.
Russia’s fall back to earth, meanwhile, spawned a kind of parlor game among academics, foreign-policy wonks, and educated investors, aimed at replacing the country in the club of major emerging-market economies. A variety of acronyms has been suggested, from the cutesy BRICET (adding Eastern Europe and Turkey) to BRICKETs (the former plus South Korea) and – an even greater stretch – BRIMC, which shoehorns Mexico into the mix.
In all of these revisions, Russia survives, despite the writing on its economic wall. While Russia retains the world’s largest (if somewhat aging) arsenal of nuclear weapons, as well as a permanent seat (and thus veto power) on the UN Security Council, it is more sick than BRIC.
Purely from the standpoint of economic potential and fundamentals, the case is far stronger for South Korea, a sophisticated economic power whose primary liability is the danger that the regime of its evil twin to the north will collapse and inundate it with hungry refugees.
The same is true of Turkey, with its robust banking sector, thriving domestic market, growing importance to Middle East and energy politics, NATO membership, European Union membership bid, and ties to ethnic cousins across Central Asia.
Perhaps the most compelling case of all is that of Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim state, with a rapidly expanding middle class, relatively stable democratic politics, and an economy that has been a star performer in Asia despite the global recession. From an American perspective, Indonesia is an attractive alternative to Russia, which recently has vied with Venezuela for leadership of the “America in decline” cheering section.
In spite of its diverse ethnic makeup and far-flung island territory, the country has made a quick transition from military dictatorship and has recovered from myriad challenges and setbacks, including the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the tsunami in 2004, the emergence of radical Islam, and domestic unrest. While Indonesia’s per capita GDP remains low, it is a country’s potential that matters in economic affairs, and here Indonesia shines.
The government in Jakarta, meanwhile, has taken a strong stand against corruption and moved to address structural problems. Even demographic trends favor Indonesia, which, with 230 million people, is already the fourth largest country in the world by population – a full Germany (80-plus million) larger than Russia.
But catchy ideas die hard, and Russia has moved to cement the current concept of the BRICs into an irreversible reality. The ossification of the BRICs into a
That meeting produced a notable broadside against the United States, as each member declared its desire to unseat the dollar as the global reserve currency. A few months earlier, the four were moved to issue a joint communiqué ahead of the G-20 Summit in April noting their shared determination to change the rules of the global economic system.
In the private sector, BRIC index funds have proliferated, though Goldman Sachs has radically hedged its own BRIC bet by introducing a second term – the “Next 11,” or N-11 – to the debate. This grouping adds
Russia sniffs at the idea of demotion, and American officials appear to have decided to steer clear of the semantic debate. Still, it should surprise no one that Russia lobbied hard for the Yekaterinburg BRIC summit, and footed the bill for much of it as well.
Another Buddha Destroyed
In northwest Pakistan’s Swat valley armed Islamist militants recently attacked one of the oldest and most important sculptures of Buddhist art. Dating from around the beginning of the Christian era, and carved into a 130-foot-high rock, the seated image of the Buddha was second in importance in South Asia only to the Bamiyan Buddhas.
Murtaza Razvi of Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper has pointed out that the image that was attacked was not in a remote area. In fact, it was next to the central road that runs through the valley.
Despite repeated requests by Pakistani archeologists to the local authorities to protect the seated Buddha and other sites, especially after the first attack, no action was taken. In fact, militants were able to carry out their work – drilling holes in the rock, filling them with explosives, and detonating them – in broad daylight.
Today, little over a decade later, the atmosphere is so poisoned that neither local community leaders nor the local police came forward to protect these monuments or claim them as their own. Even sadder is that while Pakistani newspapers widely condemned these attacks and criticized local officials’ indifference, there has been almost no coverage in the international press.
Can it be that after the Iraq war, and the dismaying images of looting at the National Museum in Baghdad, we have lost our capacity to be outraged? Or is it that we have become so inured to bad news surrounding the war on terror that we have no desire to know more?
There is a vast number of important Buddhist sites in Swat and other areas of northwest Pakistan. At this point, all of them are under threat of destruction, thanks to the influential voice of the Islamist leader Mullah Fazlullah, whose father-in-law, Sufi Mohammad, founded one of the extremist orders.
This order was responsible for bringing more than 10,000
Another Failed British Experiment
That model had been based politically on the creation of consensus, and economically on Keynesian demand management. Today, the equivalent collapse has been of the “regulation-lite” regime in which a party that styled itself as “New Labour” accepted a powerful role for markets – particularly for largely deregulated financial markets.
In the 1960’s, Keynesian policies delivered the illusion that everyone was benefiting, with high levels of employment and significant wage growth. Britain was the coolest place on earth, boasting the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the pastel fashions of Carnaby Street.
But Keynesianism involved continued fiscal expansion, with no offsetting monetary contraction. By the 1970’s, it had brought to the United Kingdom large and ultimately unsustainable current-account deficits, high levels of inflation, and then political gridlock over what to do.
In early 1974, Edward Heath’s Conservative government was locked in a struggle with the powerful coal miners’ union over “who rules Britain.” He called a premature election in February, in which there was no clear winner.
The centrist Liberal Democrats appeared to hold the balance of power, and stories circulated of how Heath was prepared to concede a reformed voting system. He held out the promise of proportional representation, which would ensure a greater number of parliamentary seats for the Liberal Democrats in future elections, in exchange for the party’s support for a new Conservative government.
There appears to be an overwhelming likelihood that the 1974 stalemate will be repeated in the upcoming general election on May 6. The political maneuvering has already started, with the unpopular incumbent prime minister, Gordon Brown, today’s equivalent of Heath, bidding for the Liberal Democrats’ support by promising a constitutional reform that would give the party major advantages.
In 1974, the touted Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition never materialized, as the Liberal Democrats were wary of hitching their fortunes to an unpopular and discredited politician. The result was a minority government that struggled for support and legitimacy, and in the end offered only policies that provided no real answer to the country’s underlying problems.
Britain today resembles 1974 much more than it resembles 1979, when the Thatcher revolution set the country on a new path. There is again a major economic problem, the end of a credit-driven boom, and a threat to the banks (except that it all looks much bigger, owing to the financial system’s massive growth and internationalization).
There is also an ominous resemblance to Italy in 1992, when both major parties of the previous 40 years, the Christian Democrats and the Communists, simply melted away in a mixture of corruption and intellectual failure.
In the 2000’s boom, as in the 1960’s, it looked as if everyone could live on the never-never. In 1960’s, it was counter-cyclical fiscal policy that held out the promise of prosperity for all; in the 2000’s, it was that individuals rather than the state piled up debt.
As in the meltdown of the 1970’s, it is easy to see how everyone benefited from the recent boom: homeowners saw their houses rising in price, social-welfare payments were expanded, and people seemed swept up in a new wave of 1960’s-style “Cool Britannia.”
Major adjustments are needed. At the same time, the main parties find it hard to address the country’s problems, because they are reluctant to call for sacrifice before an election.
And, because the party programs of the Labour government and the Conservative opposition are not clearly distinguishable, they find it hard to differentiate themselves from the Liberal Democrats. Both major parties are appealing to the political center, but they will never be as convincing as a political party that really is in the political center, and that is unencumbered by the scandals attached to the past exercise of power.
The course of the electoral struggle so far indicates that the Liberal Democrats will do very well. Their leader outshines his Conservative and Labour counterparts in television debates and on the campaign trail.
But this demand for political moderation impedes the search for the radical and painful solutions that Britain needs. Little wonder, then, that currency markets are treating the likely outcome in Britain – a hung parliament, with no clear majority for any party – as a repeat of the mid-1970’s, with no clear solution to the country’s underlying economic problems on offer.
Another Roller Coaster Ride for Exchange Rates in 2009?
The American dollar soared, the Japanese yen went into orbit, the euro fell to earth, and the British pound crashed, leaving a giant crater. Emerging-market currencies were hammered, as were “commodity currencies” such as the Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, and the South African rand.
So, what will the New Year bring for exchange rates?
In the short run, the yen and the dollar continue to benefit from a flight to safety, as panicked investors seek a place to hide. The yen and dollar are also being bolstered as central banks elsewhere continue to cut interest rates towards zero, territory that the yen and dollar policy rates already occupy.
Thus, even though the United States and Japan will not be raising interest rates anytime soon, lower foreign rates still make the dollar and yen relatively more attractive. Commodity prices will continue to be soft, pulling down commodity currencies, and bolstering the yen especially, since resource-poor Japan is so reliant on commodity imports.
Normally, short-run and long-run exchange-rate trends point in the same direction. Indeed, a huge body of research shows that for most major currencies, the best forecast of next week’s exchange rate, next month’s exchange rate, or even next year’s exchange rate is simply today’s exchange rate.
But, when more normal growth does resume, the recent trends underpinning dollar and yen appreciation will disappear. Perhaps international investors will be grateful to the US for its aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus, which will accelerate sharply when President-elect Barack Obama takes office on January 20.
Many emerging markets will also want to engage in countercyclical macroeconomic policy, but they are hemmed in by concerns of fiscal sustainability and fear of rampant inflation. European fiscal policy is constrained by the Maastricht Treaty, while European monetary policy is rather single-mindedly devoted to price stability.ampnbsp;
True, China, with its vast foreign exchange reserves, has the wherewithal to spend as much on countercyclical macroeconomic policy as anyone. But China’s rulers know that their highly repressed banking system is vulnerable as the country continues to pursue gradual financial liberalization, and that foreign currency reserves may be needed for recapitalization.
Thus perhaps no region will be as expansionary as the US.
As markets normalize, surely investors will look around and realize that the US has vastly increased its debt in fighting the downturn, possibly by several trillion dollars. At the same time, today’s falling prices (or “deflation”) will eventually morph into inflation as aggressive monetary easing takes its toll on price stability.
Admittedly, some of the major currency’s movements during the past year can be regarded as normalizing. On a purchasing power basis (a crude measure of what different currencies can buy in terms of real goods), the euro was absurdly overvalued at $1.60, just as the yen was absurdly undervalued at over ¥120 to the dollar.
Thus, the past year’s currency alignments have, to some extent, simply brought relative domestic price levels and exchange rates into better balance. But by now, emerging-market countries’ exchange rates, and even more so commodity currencies, have probably overshot on the downside.ampnbsp;
Over the long run, globalization and economic convergence will resume, and emerging market and commodity currencies will have to strengthen. At the same time, the prospect of higher US inflation and massively higher US public debt levels must eventually weigh on the dollar, as does the still worrisome US trade deficit.
If today’s constellation of exchange rates represents some excessive dollar and yen appreciation, especially against emerging-market currencies, when it will unwind? That depends on when you think the financial crisis will abate, and the timing of that is as hard to predict as exchange rates.
Answering Iran
The International Atomic Energy Agency also reports that Iran is carrying out research to develop designs for nuclear warheads. In short, Iranian officials’ claims that their nuclear program is aimed solely at power generation or medical research lacks all plausibility.
For example, we do not know whether Iran is conducting secret activities at undisclosed sites, or when Iran could develop a crude nuclear weapon, with estimates ranging from several months to several years. We also do not know whether Iran’s divided leadership has decided to develop nuclear weapons, or to stop just short, calculating that the country could derive many of the benefits of possessing nuclear weapons without running the risks or incurring the costs of actually doing so.
None is costless or risk-free. Moreover, neither the costs nor the risks are possible to calculate with precision.
This assumes that Iran could be deterred from using its weapons, much as the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. Missile defenses could be expanded; the United States could extend security guarantees so that Iran would understand that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be met with a decisive American response.
It might also transfer nuclear-related material, technology, or weapons to allies (Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela, for example) or radical organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas. And, rather than promoting caution and stability in the region, Iran or Israel could be tempted to strike first in a crisis.
Nor can it be assumed that Iran’s divided and radical leadership would always act rationally, or that proliferation would stop with the Islamic Republic. If Iran develops its nuclear weapons, countries such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt would be tempted to purchase or develop nuclear weapons of their own.
At the opposite end of the spectrum of policy choices is a preventive attack: a military strike (most likely by Israel, the US, or both) against sites in Iran associated with its nuclear program. The core objective would be to interrupt the emergence of a threat that is still gathering.
Even a successful preventive attack would at most set back Iran’s nuclear program a few years. It would almost certainly be rebuilt, presumably in underground, fortified sites that would make future attacks far more difficult to carry out.
If all of this happened, the price of oil would skyrocket owing to shortages and fears, possibly driving much of the world economy, already in a precarious position, into recession. An armed attack could also cause the Iranian public to rally around the government, reducing the chances that a more responsible leadership might emerge.
It thus comes as little surprise that the US and much of the world have explored alternatives, including regime change in Iran. But, however desirable that might be, no policy can assuredly bring it about.
It is becoming more difficult for Iran (whose economy depends to a large extent on oil exports of more than two million barrels a day) to find customers – and especially customers willing to pay full price. Meanwhile, Iran’s currency is weakening, pricing imported goods out of many Iranians’ reach.
Additional elements of current policy that seem to be having an effect are clandestine efforts aimed at impeding Iran’s ability to import sensitive technologies. Viruses have infiltrated computers in Iran, reducing the efficiency of the centrifuges central to enriching uranium.
So one question is whether existing sanctions can be extended and tightened; here, China and Russia must determine their priorities. Another question is whether any sanctions will be enough to persuade Iran’s leaders to accept verifiable limits on their nuclear program.
Indeed, the only certainty may be that Iran’s nuclear program will be a major international issue in 2012 – quite possibly the most important one.
रोगाणुरोधी प्रतिरोध के ख़िलाफ़ निष्पक्ष लड़ाई
ब्राइटन - मौजूदा रोगाणु-रोधी दवाएँ अप्रभावी होती जा रही हैं। अगर मौजूदा रुझान जारी रहते हैं, तो हम एंटीबायोटिक की खोज से पहले की स्थितियों में दोबारा जी रहे होंगे, जब संक्रामक रोग प्रमुख प्राणघातक थे।
दवा-रोधी रोगाणुओं की चुनौती का सामना करना कठिन होगा। इसके लिए न केवल नई रोगाणु-रोधी दवाओं के अनुसंधान और विकास में प्रमुख निवेश की ज़रूरत होगी, बल्कि नए इलाजों को नियंत्रित और सीमित करने की ज़रूरत भी होगी, ताकि उनकी प्रभावकारिता संरक्षित रखी जा सके। जैसा कि जलवायु परिवर्तन पर प्रतिक्रिया के साथ है, प्रभावी रणनीति के लिए अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समन्वय की ज़रूरत होगी। ख़ास तौर से, सरकारी भुगतानकर्ताओं और वैश्विक ग़रीबों के साथ फ़ार्मास्यूटिकल कंपनियों की ज़रूरतों का समाधान किया जाना चाहिए।
दरअसल, किसी भी प्रयास के लिए ग़रीबों को जोड़ना महत्वपूर्ण होगा। निम्न और मध्यम आय वाले देश दवा-रोधी जीवों के महत्वपूर्ण स्रोत हैं। भीड़-भाड़ वाले आवास, ख़राब स्वच्छता, और प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली को ख़तरे में डालना, चाहे वह कुपोषण या HIV जैसे जीर्ण संक्रमण के कारण हो, संक्रमण के लिए उपजाऊ ज़मीन प्रदान करते हैं। एंटीबायोटिक का अक्सर दुरुपयोग किया जाता है या उनकी गुणवत्ता कम होती है, जिससे बैक्टीरिया को प्रतिरोध विकसित करने का अवसर मिलता है। एंटीबायोटिक की बड़ी मात्रा का इस्तेमाल पशुपालन में भी किया जाता है। इस बीच, परिवहन की बुनियादी सुविधाओं में अत्यधिक सुधार - ग्रामीण और शहरी क्षेत्रों के बीच और देशों के बीच - का मतलब है कि प्रतिरोधी जीन शीघ्र वैश्विक पूल का हिस्सा बन जाते हैं।
कई असुरक्षित देशों में, सरकारी स्वास्थ्य-देखभाल प्रणाली माँग पूरा नहीं कर पाती, और विविध प्रदाता इस खाई को पाटने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। इनमें चिकित्सा विशेषज्ञों से लेकर अनौपचारिक प्रदाता तक शामिल हैं, जो मुख्यतः विनियामक ढाँचे के बाहर काम करते हैं। पैबंद वाली इन प्रणालियों के लाभ भी हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, बांग्लादेश में एक ताज़ा अध्ययन में निष्कर्ष निकाला गया है कि अक्सर बाज़ार के स्टालों से संचालन करने वाले तथाकथित "गाँव के डॉक्टरों" द्वारा प्रदान की जाने वाली एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं ने प्रसवोत्तर रोगाणुता और बचपन के निमोनिया से मृत्यु दर में गिरावट लाने में योगदान किया है। लेकिन इसके भी काफ़ी सबूत हैं कि प्रदान की जा रही दवाएँ विविध गुणवत्ता की होती हैं और अक्सर उन्हें बिना आवश्यकता के ले लिया जाता है। बहुत बार, रोगी इलाज का पूरा कोर्स नहीं ख़रीदते।
इस पर एक प्रतिक्रिया यह हो सकती है कि ऐसे क़ानून तैयार और लागू किए जाएँ जिनसे एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ केवल डॉक्टर के पर्चे पर उपलब्ध हो सकें। बहरहाल, इसके परिणामस्वरूप एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं तक ग़रीब लोगों की पहुँच गंभीर रूप से सीमित हो सकती है, जिससे संक्रमण से मृत्यु दर उच्च हो सकती है, जो इसे राजनीतिक रूप से अस्वीकार्य और इसलिए लागू करने में मुश्किल बना देगा। इसका बेहतर विकल्प यह होगा कि एंटीबायोटिक इलाजों को बेहतर बनाने के लिए ऐसी नई रणनीतियाँ विकसित की जाएँ जिनसे इन्हें अनौपचारिक स्रोतों के माध्यम से प्रदान किया जाए।
शुरूआत करनेवालों के लिए, उन दवाओं पर भरोसेमंद निगरानी डेटा उत्पन्न करने के लिए निवेश करने की ज़रूरत है जो आ�� संक्रमण के ख़िलाफ़ प्रभावी हैं। इलाज के दिशा-निर्देशों में यह जानकारी शामिल की जानी चाहिए और एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के सभी प्रदाताओं की दी जानी चाहिए।
इस बीच, उच्च गुणवत्ता वाली एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ किफ़ायती क़ीमतों पर उपलब्ध कराई जानी चाहिए। नकली उत्पादों की पहचान की जानी चाहिए और उन्हें बाज़ार से निकाल दिया जाना चाहिए, और गुणवत्ता नियंत्रित करने के लिए सरकारों, फ़ार्मास्यूटिकल क्षेत्र, और नागरिक समूहों के बीच नियामक साझेदारी विकसित की जानी चाहिए। क़ीमतों को थोक ख़रीद के माध्यम से कम रखा जाना चाहिए; कुछ मामलों में, सार्वजनिक आर्थिक सहायता भी ज़रूरी हो सकती है।
क़ीमतों को कम करने के उपायों के पूरक के रूप में बहुत ज़्यादा इस्तेमाल को हतोत्साहित करने की ज़रूरत होगी। पैकेजिंग में नवाचार, शायद दवाओं के उचित संयोजन का पूरा कोर्स उपलब्ध कराना, इलाज के फ़ैसले को आसान बना सकेगा। इसी तरह, कम-लागत की नैदानिक प्रौद्योगिकियों का विकास केवल लक्षणों के आधार पर इलाज प्रदान करने की ज़रूरत कम करने में मदद कर सकता है।
सबसे बड़ी चुनौती एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के प्रदाताओं को अपना व्यवहार बदलने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करना होगी। इसके लिए, तकनीकी सहायता देने और कार्य-निष्पादन की निगरानी के लिए मान्यता, भुगतान तंत्र के संशोधन, और मध्यस्थ संगठनों की भागीदारी जैसे उपायों की ज़रूरत होगी। इन संगठनों में गैर-सरकारी संगठन, धार्मिक संगठन, सामाजिक उद्यमी, और दवाएँ वितरित करने वाली कंपनियाँ शामिल हो सकती हैं। इसकी संभावना नहीं है कि ये गतिविधियाँ वाणिज्यिक रूप से स्थायी हो सकेंगी, और इसलिए इनके लिए सरकारों, परोपकारी संस्थाओं, और शायद दवा उत्पादकों से समर्थन की ज़रूरत होगी।
इस बीच, लोगों को एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के समुचित इस्तेमाल पर भरोसेमंद जानकारी और सलाह मिलनी चाहिए। यह ख़ास तौर से वहाँ महत्वपूर्ण है जहाँ नागरिक स्वास्थ्य की समस्याओं से निपटने के लिए काफ़ी हद तक अपने खुद के संसाधनों पर निर्भर करते हैं।
एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के इस्तेमाल में प्रणाली में व्यापक बदलाव लागू करने के लिए राष्ट्रीय और वैश्विक गठबंधनों की ज़रूरत होगी। एक मुख्य लक्ष्य स्वास्थ्य कर्मियों और दवा कंपनियों के आचरण के बुनियादी मानक स्थापित करना होगा जिसमें रोगियों और समुदायों की ज़रूरतें प्रतिबिंबित हों। सरकारों को इस प्रक्रिया में प्रभावी भूमिका निभाने के लिए अपनी क्षमता का निर्माण करने की ज़रूरत होगी, और दवाओं और नैदानिक प्रौद्योगिकियों का विकास, उत्पादन, और वितरण करने वाली कंपनियों को सहयोगी समाधानों की खोज के लिए सक्रिय रूप से योगदान करना होगा। हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं से सही रूप में लाभ तभी उठा सकेंगे जब हम उनका निष्पक्ष और स्थायी तरीके से प्रबंधन कर सकेंगे।
