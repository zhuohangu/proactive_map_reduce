But there is a new and growing danger that these advances might not be sustained. Peter Mugyenyi, who runs the Joint Clinical Research Center, told me that part of the problem is the sheer weight of numbers.
Countries such as Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, as well as Uganda, are requesting assistance for emergency drug supplies. In Kampala, Dr. Mugyenyi has begun placing new patients on a waiting list.
Compounding the problem: donors have also been shifting their focus from AIDS to other diseases, because there is a sense that more lives can be saved more cheaply. At a time when we should be scaling up to meet the AIDS challenge, we are dialing back.
How do you choose to treat a young girl but not her little brother? How do you turn away a pregnant mother, sitting with her children, crying for help?
In Washington recently, the United Nations rolled out an action plan that should dramatically accelerate progress on maternal and child health, including HIV. At the International AIDS Conference in Vienna, in July, I hope that the international community will rally around UNAIDS’ launch of Treatment 2.0 — the next generation of HIV treatment, which must be more affordable, more effective, and accessible to all.
As chair of this year’s replenishment of the Global Fund, I urge all donors to see to it that countries such as Uganda get the support they need, so that Dr. Mugyenyi and other front-line soldiers in the fight against AIDS need not make those difficult choices.
I left Uganda with a snatch of song that still echoes within my heart. Its inherent truth would be obvious, had you been there to see:&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To our countries, to our families.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All we need is a way to live our days,
